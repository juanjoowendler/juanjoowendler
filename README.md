# Hello, I'm Juanjo

I am a final-year student of Information Systems Engineering. My professional interests are to specialize in either Backend Software Development or Data Science. I am seeking my first opportunity in IT as a Trainee or Junior to build and consolidate my professional career. I have real hands-on experience in personal and academic projects, and a strong conversational level of English.
